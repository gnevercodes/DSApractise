# Trees

`prerequisites : recursion , OOP `.

- recursion is needed to solve tree problems.

## why trees?

> many nodes are connected together.

1. insertion , deletion , find elements in O(log(n)) times.
2. ordered inseriton and deletion.
3. cost efficient.

Limitation :

1. unbalanced binary tree.
2. inefficient for sorted data.

use cases:

1. file systems.
2. data bases.

### how to solve this problem .

1. self balancing binary tree.
2.
