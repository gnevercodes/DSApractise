# Recursion recap for DSA.

## important point

1. recursion is a repetitive call to a function.
2. these functions have the same body .
3. instead of having multiple functions doing same thing , call the func itself.
4. add `check**`.
5. `base condition - simple if condtion`.
6. This checks if the future code must be exectued or not .
