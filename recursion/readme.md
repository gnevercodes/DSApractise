# Recursion recap for DSA.

## important point

1. recursion is a repetitive call to a function.
2. these functions have the same body .
3. instead of having multiple functions doing same thing , call the func itself.
4. add `check**`.
5. `base condition - simple if condtion`.
6. This checks if the future code must be exectued or not .
7. even though the same func is called again , this is treated as a seperate memory in the stack and it must be completed to return to the original func that called this func.

### why recursion?

> it helps us in solving complex probls in a simple way.
> you can convert recursion solution into iterations and vice versa.

### when to use recursion :

1. space complexity is not constant because of recursive calls.
2. breaking bigger probs into smaller problems.
