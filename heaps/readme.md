# Heaps.

## Notes

1. Heap is a speacialized tree that helps you get maximum or the min element.
2. Heap is a `Complete Binary tree`(all levels are filled except the bottem level) with a heap property .

## Types of Heap :

- Min Heap where parent <= children.
- max heap where parent >= children.

## How heap is implemented ?

1. Firstly , it's a complete binary tree meanin all the leaves are being filled.
2. These are then being efficiently stored in the arrays.
3. stored as an array , represented as a TREE.
