# Generics

## will be creating arraylist and learn how generics work .

### class on revisiting OOPS concepts for interview prep.

> will be learning lambda expressions , exception handling , object cloning.

## Arraylist

1. linear TC.
2. takes only wrapper classes.

- [*] work on generics

## Comparable

1. interface Comparable<Object>
2. it has method compareTo method to be overridden.
3. generics must be added on which one you're comparing

## lambda

- [*] get a hang of it.

## Object cloning.

we can save process time
a. so instead of doing the " new " keyword to create new object.
b. we will be doing clone
c. this is a method in lang
d. This is a interface.

shallow copy : partial copy
primitives are copied
objects are linked via reference variable.

Deep copy : we basically make sure we do not point the obj reference variables to another one.
