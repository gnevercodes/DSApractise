A LinkedList is a linear data structure where each element (called a node) contains:
	â€¢	The data itself
	â€¢	A reference (pointer) to the next node in the sequence

Unlike arrays, elements in a LinkedList are not stored in contiguous memory. Instead, theyâ€™re linked together using pointers, allowing for efficient insertions and deletions without shifting elements.

ðŸ’¡ Key Features:
	â€¢	Dynamic size â€” grows and shrinks at runtime
	â€¢	Efficient insertions/deletions (especially at beginning or middle)
	â€¢	Slower access than arrays (O(n) to find elements)
	â€¢	Built using self-referential classes (e.g., Node class pointing to another Node)
